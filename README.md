To run the app, you need to have Mongo running.

Install dependencies - npm i
Run the app - slc run
Open the explorer - http://localhost:3000/explorer
Open the coffeeshop map - http://localhost:3000/index.html
When you run the app for the first time, the database is empty and you dont see any data on the map.
Open coffeeshops.json in the root directory of the app and copy the contents of that file.
Make a post request to /api/CoffeeShops from the explorer. This will add all the coffee shops to the mongo db.
Reload http://localhost:3000/index.html. You should now see the coffeeshops on the map.
